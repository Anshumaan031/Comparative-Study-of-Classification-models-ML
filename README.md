# Comparative-Study-of-Classification-models-ML
<h1>Objective 1:</h1>
Classification Models: Build different classification models from Sklearn
such as Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification,
Random Forest Classification, Adaboost Classification, Gradient Boost
Classification and Neural Network (from keras). Train these models with
default parameters. For Neural Networks train a simple Predict the labels
in the testing set. Apply classification metrics such as accuracy, confusion
matrix, precision, recall, f-measure, ROC Curve etc. Visualize the
classification metrics as graphs.</br>
<h1>Objective 2:</h1>
Comparative Study: Compare the 7 classification models by plotting bar
graphs of precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy. Plot the confusion
matrix of models individually. Plot the ROC curves of different models in
same line graph. </br>
